Introduction to GitHub Repositories 

Professional Summary: 

Hello GitHub users, my name is Justin Campbell. I am an aspiring machine learning/data analytics professional with plans to continue my undergraduate computer science education at Colorado State University in the fall of 2020. Since graduating from high school in 2016, I have changed curricula twice, where I majored in Biomedical Engineering and Ocean Engineering respectively at Texas A&M University in College Station. It is through this education that I was able to better realize my strengths in the fields of mathematics, statistics, and programming; preparing me for an exciting career shift in a growing industry. I look forward to using this platform as a way to expand my network, and to collaborate on projects with other like-minded coders :)
